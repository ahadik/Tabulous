##Keyboard Accessibility Prototyping

Accessibility is rarely considered during the design process, and is instead left to the very end when the team is reviewing the final details. However, integrating accessibility into product development early on results in superior solutions for all users.

Keyboard accessibility is a core tenent of a fully accessible product. Designers have the opportunity to define the order and priority of tabs in an interface, which directly impacts the usability of an interface for physically disabled users, as well as power users who want fast keyboard commands.

##Use
Tabulous is a tool enabling designers to iterate, evaluate and communicate the keyboard accessibility of a proposed design. You can access the app at [www.betabulous.com](http://www.betabulous.com) to begin using. You'll just need to log-in using Facebook. From there you can create projects and start prototyping.
